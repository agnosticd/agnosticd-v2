= Cloud Provider plays

Here are the ansible code dealing with Cloud Provisioning. It is separated in two files for each Cloud provider:

* `infrastructure_deployment.yml`
+
Provision the environment (instances, VPC, dns, etc) using a template from the config. Ex: for AWS, it's a Cloudformation template.

* `destroy_env.yml`
+
Detroy the environment (instances, VPC, dns, etc).

All additional roles should be created in a collection available in the https://github.com/rhpds organization. The collection must be named
`agnosticd.cloud_providers_<cloud provider name>` so for example `agnosticd.cloud_providers_aws`.

== Adding a new Cloud Provider

* Steps:
** Add the plays for deployment and and destroy environment.
** Create a new collection for any supporting roles
** Ensure the collection has a role to manage the lifecycle.
* Update `../setup_runtime.yml` to add the provider to the `agnosticd_cloud_providers` variable
